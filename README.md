# 🕵️‍♂️ API Detective: Automated Microservice QA Framework

**API Detective** creates keen observability in microservice communication, delivering an environment agnostic manner to intelligently observe, test and monitor micro service integration, with instant visibility into failures—perfect for keeping service contracts rock‑solid during every deployment. runs seamlessly in CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions or Jenkins; producing dynamic detective-style HTML reports for every test run.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

* Runs complete **API test suites** across multiple services automatically.
* Generates rich, **HTML reports** as artifacts, that visualize request/response flows and failures at the end of each run.
* Integrates directly with **GitHub Actions** and **Jenkins** for continuous QA feedback.
* Uses **PowerShell automation** to manage multi-collection execution with clean logging.
* Centralized environment configs for staging, integration, and production.

## ❓❓ Why It Matters

API Detective isn't just about running tests; it's about creating observability in microservice communication.
It models how a real QA pipeline should behave: intelligent orchestration, consistent environments, and instant visibility into what's breaking and why.
It also provides a robust regression safety net, ensuring service contracts remain intact across deployments.

## ⚙️ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sphinx010/API-Detective.git
   cd API-Detective
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install -g newman newman-reporter-htmlextra
   ```

3. **Run all tests**

   ```powershell
   ./scripts/run_all_collections.ps1
   ```

4. **View results**
   Open the generated reports in:

   ```
   newman/reports/
   ```
   or download the results as a zip-file at the end of the workflow's run..

### My observation/reflection

API Detective demonstrates how a **QA engineer can design a full automation ecosystem**  and not just test, but harmonize scripting, CI/CD, and intelligent reporting.
It’s the kind of framework that turns manual verification into continuous assurance.
